Generatetive neural networks Weak Control Signals
    Starke use weak signal and input noise. More noise, better animation, and less control.


Control Theory

Function approximations 
    RBF, movement primitives

Motion planning
    Robotics
    Graph based stuff

\kenny{what is state of the art work to compare against?}


\subsection{Animation Warping}
Animation warping can be viewed as a generative model trained on $D$.
