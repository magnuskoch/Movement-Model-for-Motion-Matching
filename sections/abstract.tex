\begin{abstract}
In this paper we present a method to extract models from reference animations that can reproduce movement from user input. Although much work has been to done to create realistic full body character animation there is a lack of methods for performing the supplementary task of accurate modeling between user input and future trajectory. This is important for systems that use weak control signals to guide animation synthesis, but especially for computer games where the character position is typically mapped directly to the estimated trajectory with animations overlaid as a secondary effect that is not allowed to diverge. When there is a discrepancy visual artifacts appear and a tedious manual alignment process is required to avoid this.


In some contexts this modeling task can be relaxed by allowing the 

handled by rough approximations 


and the system that generate animaitions (weak control signal). This component is very important in games since it has a dual role (character positon and weak contorl).




Al llt of work focus on full body



It is challenging to create game animaition controllers. We need realism and we also need a quick response to user input. Further we cannot depend on animation to actually move the character.
