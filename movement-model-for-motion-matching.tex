\subsection{Elevator Pitch}
In game development it is a common construct to have character position driven by a simple algorithmic model that responds to player input.
\\ 
In-place animations are then played at the position given by the model at any given time.
\\
If the model movement matches poorly with the movement in the animations, the character will appear to float.
\\
We propose a general \textit{Movement Model} and optimization framework that ensures synchronization between animations and model. 
\\
It is our believe that such a synchronization could also be of use on generative system, as a way to provide better input to eg. neural networks.

\subsection{Verification}
Remove root motion from animation. Replay in-place animation on top of movement model. If there is no sliding, we have a perfect match.
